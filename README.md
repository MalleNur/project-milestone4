## Project Idea

This website is an interactive community for book lovers to either meetup or socialize throught the website to connect and discuss the books assigned for reading through popular vote.

The members can post details of the books to be read, leave comments or suggest new books for the group to read and discuss. The members can also collectively choose which book that will be next on the reading list of suggested books.

  ### Design
  
   - Layout
     
     The website has a simple layout where the user can see the logo and site navigation along with a top bar and simple footer on the bottom of the website. A Bootstrap board is used for content to be displayed as a styled section for the main page.
     
   - Content
     
     The site admin will be in charge of creating the content as constructing books and meet & greet items. 
     Details of the books will be displyed below the image on smaller screens and shift to the right of the image on larger screens.
     It will also be the same for the book list as well as the meetup book.
     There will be a default placeholder image shown in place of the user choosing a bookcover image.
     
   - User Input
   
     Data is updated by using Bootstrap forms. For this project i am using either Bootstrap buttons or Fontawsome icons for all user interaction controls.
     
   - Typography
   
     The Google font Roboto was used for this project.
     
   - Imagery
   
     There is no background image needed for this project. BookCircle members have the ability to upload an image of a book cover to draw the user's attention to the meet & greet information. In the absence of a user-uploaded image, a default placeholder image of an untitled book cover is used.
